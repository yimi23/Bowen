```

## 🧠 AUTONOMOUS LEARNING IN ACTION

```
User: "Help me understand BCNF in database design"

BOWEN: [Doesn't know BCNF initially]
✅ Detects "BCNF" as unknown concept
✅ Researches Boyce-Codd Normal Form automatically
✅ Learns definition, examples, use cases, best practices
✅ Saves to persistent knowledge base with connections
✅ Applies new knowledge to answer user's question
✅ Future questions about BCNF use learned knowledge
```
